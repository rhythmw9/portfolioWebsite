# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio site. It's built to showcase who I am, what I’ve worked on, and how to get in touch. It’s responsive, clean, and easy to navigate. Every page is kept simple and purposeful.

## Overview

The site has five main pages:
- **Home** – Quick intro with a photo and welcome message
- **About** – A more in-depth look at who I am and what I’m focused on
- **Projects** – Highlights of my key projects and work
- **Blog** – A space for writing and sharing ideas (coming soon)
- **Contact** – A form to reach out directly
